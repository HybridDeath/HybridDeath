# Hi, Iâ€™m @HybridDeath
## I'm 20, and I'm from Poland. ðŸ¥‡
- **My hobbies**:
    - My beloved team called **New Fireflies**, made in 2019 `MTA (2019 - May 2022) / Public (today)`
    - Anime `mainly ecchi, psychological, thrillers and school series, my taste is wide :D`
    - Translating from English to Polish and vice-versa
- **Iâ€™m currently learning**:
    - Lua (since this is my primary programming language)
- **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on**:
    - nothing right now
- **Full history**:
    - MTA: San Andreas (almost 20 servers):
      - helper `2016 - 2017`
      - classic admin `2017`
      - beginner scripter `2017`
      - first touch with SQL and databases `2017`
      - first accident where whole server crashed and I was kicked from staff `2017`
      - after 4 servers no one wanted to teach me how to work with server properly so,
      - I create my own server, reaching top of 22 players `2017 - 2018`
      - in conclusion, I close my server, having a lot of knowledge, new friends and people to learn from `2018`
      - I join one of biggest projects having 200 players constantly. `2018`
      - new socket API is added, making servers safer by adding Discord and email verification, but I don't get to know how it works, which decreases my motivation.
      - I am working on more servers but get kicked because of skirmishes with owners `2018 - 2019`
      - I understand SQL, and post my help on various forums `2019`
      - for that help I get to know Lua better, making me,
      - advanced scripter (2019)
      - I also play a lot on a small RPG server with other people where "Fireflies" crew starts from a small ember `2019 - 2020`
      - I join smaller but more extensive projects, focusing on understanding all scripts and making my own `2020`
      - I had a lot of fun mainly creating small gamemodes on RP servers `2020`
      - except playing on main gamemode being RPG, I start playing racing gamemode server Need For Speed: San Andreas, because of it's custom scripts that caught my eye `2020`
      - I create my own crew on aforementioned server called "Fireflies" (2020 - today)
      - I've never seen MTA as a way to go with coding.
      - I've never got paid for what I did.
      - I've never liked admin job, but I was a good admin, at least that's what I think.
      - I've never wanted to be advertising producer.
      - I summarize my "scripting" part of MTA: San Andreas as such: 
      
      **I learned SQL from MTA and that's what makes me sorta databases admin and I want to continue that arc.**
      **MTA history ends in 2022, making it 6 years journey.**
      **Today as of 2024, I've decided to take out the scripting part I've learnt in MTA, and extract all of my knowledge to create something myself**
      
    - Mindustry:
      - I became Mindustry PL Translator (2021 - 2022)
      - I end my journey here, that history is not interesting because of other people biting me for bad translating...

      **Summary: You can't just translate names**

    - Terraria:
      - I become Calamity Mod Polish Translator (2021 - today (work stopped due to owner being lazy))
      - I become Calamity Mod Polish Music Translator (Musixmatch account with same name)
      - I become Multidimension Mod Coder and Spriter (2021 - today)
      - Somewhere here Fireflies become "New Fireflies" because of what one of admins have done...
      - Also somewhere here I'm starting to be interested in making videos and music.
      - I start making Multidimension Add-on which gets rejected for being out of context and is not related with the mod's storyline and yeah it pretty much was (can't spoil)
      - My journey through modding Terraria becomes far more fun than going thru MTA (2022)
      - I start making a new mod while still helping Multidimension Mod grow (today)

      **I have completed this part of my journey with Terraria, now moving on to LOVE, since it goes back to roots of my coding expierience with MTA**
