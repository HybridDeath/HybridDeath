    - MTA: San Andreas `Lua`
    - Terraria `C#`
    - Mindustry
- **Full history**:
    - MTA: San Andreas (almost 20 servers):
      - beginner helper `2016 - 2017`
      - classic admin (watching players and helping in minor stuff) `2017`
      - beginner scripter `2017`
      - first touch with SQL and databases `2017`
      - first accident where whole server crashed and I was kicked from staff `2017`
      - after 4 servers no one wanted to teach me how to work with server properly so,
      - I create my own server, reaching top of 22 players `2017 - 2018`
      - in conclusion, I close my server, having a lot of knowledge, new friends and people to teach from `2018`
      - I join one of biggest projects in 2018 having 200 players constantly.
      - new socket API is added, making servers safer by adding Discord and email verification, but I don't get to know how it works.
      - I am working on more servers but get kicked because of skirmishes with owners `2018 - 2019`
      - I understand SQL, and post my help on various forums `2019`
      - for that help I get to know Lua better, making me,
      - advanced scripter (2019)
      - I also play a lot on a small RPG server with other people where "Fireflies" crew starts from a small ember `2019 - 2020`
      - I join smaller but more extensive projects, focusing on understanding all scripts and making my own `2020`
      - I had a lot of fun mainly creating small gamemodes on RPG servers `2020`
      - except playing on main gamemode being RPG, I start playing racing gamemode server Need For Speed: San Andreas, because of it's custom scripts that caught my eye `2020`
      - I create my own crew on aforementioned server called "Fireflies" (2020 - today)
      - I never got paid for what I did.
      - I summarize my "scripting" part of MTA: San Andreas as such: 
      
      **I learned SQL from MTA and that's what makes me sorta databases admin and I want to continue that arc.**
